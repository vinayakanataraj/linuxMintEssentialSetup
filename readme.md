This script installs a bunch of apps which I was lazy to install by myself.

Installation instructions:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the "setup.sh" file.

3. run the command:
        ./setup.sh

4. Provide your password

5. Wait for the setup to finish (patiently)

if you want to modify this installeer, then you can comment out any line you want by adding a # in the beginning of the line (open the setup file using some text editor).

bye
